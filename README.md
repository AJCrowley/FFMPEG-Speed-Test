# FFMPEG Speed Test
A simple script to test the speed of different versions of FFMPEG.
Just edit the variables at the top of index.php to make sure the script is pointing to the correct executables. Also make sure that you have a source video file in the webroot (or wherever, just point it to the correct file in the variables).

It's also really simple to edit this to test the speed of any binaries against each other.
